## About

This repository contains my solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). I'll try to solve them on more than one programming language to improve and keep my problem solving and programming skills.

## Usage

Run in your terminal ``docker compose up -d``. The output will be a file in the same directory with txt extension.
To use it without docker make sure you have installed the programs in the section bellow and run ``python start.py``.

## Problems

1. Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.
2. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
3. What is the largest prime factor of the number $600851475143$?
